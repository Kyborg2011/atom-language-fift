# Fift language support for Atom

Syntax highlightning for the [Fift programming language](https://test.ton.org/fiftbase.pdf) to the [Atom editor](https://atom.io).

Install this package via the Settings Pane or by using the Atom Package Manager:

    apm install language-fift



## Further development

The first version (*0.0.1*) factually a fork from [atom-language-forth](https://github.com/mpgirro/atom-language-forth) without any real fixes. I am inviting everybody, who involved into **[TON blockchain](https://test.ton.org)** development, to make some fixes in sintax highlighting to make development of smart contracts  in Atom much better!
